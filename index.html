    <p>Hi! I'm an aspiring coder who really likes coding and styling things!</p>
    <p>
      I also draw and write a lot! I don't usually post pictures of myself on
      the internet, so that's why I'm using pictures of Siffrin from In Stars
      And Time to represent myself.
    </p>
    <p>I am very passionate about my interests.</p>
